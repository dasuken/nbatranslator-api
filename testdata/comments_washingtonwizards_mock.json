Sprung for the behind the bench seats and had a few observations I put in the game thread, but I'll add them here too with the pics as proof.\n\n1. The Wiz staff use ESPN box scores to track the in game stats like fouls and shit. How the hell does that happen in this day and age?\n2. I was super impressed by WUJ after being somewhat skeptical. He was fucking passionate in person during timeouts like I never saw on TV. This dude was drawing up good plays that weren't getting executed well (which is partly on him I'm sure because the buck has to stop somewhere), but he was doing the things I want to see in a coach, and dudes looked bought-in.\n3. Kuz' water bottle says \"Kuz' Secret Stuff\" which is pretty funny.\n4. KCP seems like a good ass teammate. He's loud on the bench for guys and yelling at the refs when they're fucking up.\n5. The only time WUJ seemed like he \"didn't like\" Rui was when Rui passed up a 3 and got called for a travel. WUJ layed into him for passing up the good look.\n6. Wow the refs are awful from that close. Like really insanely bad.\n7. Ish is fiery as hell and seems like a real leader.\n8. Neto and Deni watch the jumbotron car race shit full interest.\n9. Kispert has a fucking death stare for no reason. He looked towards me for a sec and I thought he was gonna kill me even though I never said shit heckle-wise.\n10. The assistant coaches on the end of the bench were getting so mad on defense when our guys kept going over screens on Hart after they explicitly told everyone to go under. They also got made because we were fucking silent on defense, not calling stuff out.\n\nOverall I was impressed by the passion of everyone, but it seems like our team has a lot to work on execution wise. They also just got a ton of 50/50 calls though and we missed a ton of makable shots (Kuz especially).","author":"The_Koopa_King","author_fullname":"t2_cjwcgi15","author_flair_text":"Rui Hachimura :rui:","author_flair_template_id":"c751ea7c-2a2f-11e8-bba5-0e2872acb890","subreddit":"washingtonwizards","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/washingtonwizards","subreddit_id":"t5_2t1nv","likes":null,"score":2,"controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_td2tkr","is_submitter":true,"score_hidden":false,"saved":false,"stickied":false,"locked":false,"can_gild":true,"over_18":false,"replies":null}]
