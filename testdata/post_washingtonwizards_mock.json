Three straight games of 0 points. This road trip is a trip straight from hell. Don't tell me he isn't getting minutes (19, 11, 14). He's taken 10 shots in those three games. His offensive game has completely regressed.\n\nEven before that his shots are coming off completely open looks; it seems like he can barely create shots for himself and has to be spoonfed the ball. I've never seen this level of regression; his defence has been subpar (by his standards) or mediocre by the teams, not like those are high standards.","likes":null,"score":3,"upvote_ratio":1,"num_comments":1,"subreddit":"washingtonwizards","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/washingtonwizards","subreddit_id":"t5_2t1nv","subreddit_subscribers":120911,"author":"Great-Engr","author_fullname":"t2_jelkgzw7","spoiler":false,"locked":false,"over_18":false,"is_self":true,"saved":false,"stickied":false},{"id":"td1u1o","name":"t3_td1u1o","created_utc":"2022-03-13T07:41:05Z","edited":false,"permalink":"/r/washingtonwizards/comments/td1u1o/josh_hart_tremont_watford_and_drew_eubanks_vs_the/","url":"https://i.redd.it/x779vzepu3n81.jpg","title":"Josh Hart, Tremont Watford and Drew Eubanks vs the Wizards.
